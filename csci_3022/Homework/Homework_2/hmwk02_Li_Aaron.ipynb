    "This assignment is due on Canvas by **5 PM on Friday February 15**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

    "- Any relevant data sets should be available under the **Data** module on Canvas, as well as in the zipped folder in which you obtained this assignment. To make life easier on the graders if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",

    "Courtney, Nick and Jarrod are playing special version of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)\">Monopoly</a>. Because the three of them are all scoundrels, they are all currently in Jail. In Monopoly, players roll two 6-sided dice on their turn. In their version of Monopoly, however, to get out of Jail, a player must roll *doubles* (the two dice have the same outcome) and must keep re-rolling the dice until they get doubles during their first turn in Jail. As soon as a player rolls doubles, they are let out of Jail and their turn ends. Let $D$ represent the event that a player rolls doubles.\n",

    "**Part B**: Use your function from **Part A** to simulate at least 5000 games of Miniopoly for 20 turns, 40 turns and 60 turns, and make a **density** histogram of the player's cash at the end of the game under all 3 scenarios for number of turns. The histogram box faces should be slightly transparent, so as to be able to tell the 3 game-length scenarios apart. For all three histograms, use bins of width \\$250, starting at 0 on the left and extending as far to the right as needed. As always, be sure to label your axes and include an informative legend.\n",
